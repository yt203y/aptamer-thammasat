# Aptamer@Thammasat Research Unit

The research unit was established by Thammasat University to strengthen its research capabilities in molecular therapeutics.  Our unit currently comprises four investigators from Faculties of Science and Technology, and Medicine at Thammasat University.

# Members
1. **Head of Research Unit:** Associate Professor Dr. Boonchoy Soontornworajit 
2. Assistant Professor Dr. Pichayanoot Rotkrua
3. Assistant Professor Dr. Jiraporn Arunpanichlert
4. [Associate Professor Dr. Yuthana Tantirungrotechai](https://yt203y.github.io/CVyt/)

# Research Focus
We explore the possibility of using Molecular Hybrids for biomedical applications.  Our current focus is on aptamer-based systems for cancer treatment.
